Certainly, here's a `readme.md` file that links to the 12 repositories and includes a welcome note to PIAIC:

# Welcome to PIAIC JavaScript/TypeScript Projects

Welcome to the Public Repository of PIAIC (Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence & Computing) JavaScript/TypeScript projects by [Nazneen Akram](https://github.com/Nazneen-akram). Here you'll find a collection of JavaScript and TypeScript projects developed as part of the PIAIC coursework that I am submitting for grading.

As per [Mr. Hamzah Syed's](https://github.com/Hamzah-syed) instruction, I had earlier created separate repositories for each of the twelve project. However, this repository enlists the path as one list for easy access to the projects.
